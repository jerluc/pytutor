# Introduction

## What is PyTutor?

PyTutor is a tutorial series meant for learning and teaching programming through Python.

## Who is this for?

PyTutor is intended for a mostly non-technical audience. No prior programming experience is assumed, however familiarity with using a computer and an open mind are an absolute must!

## Why should I choose PyTutor over X, Y, or Z?

The short answer is: **you shouldn't!**

I personally find that the process of learning a completely new subject is to really dive deep into several texts in order to gain multiple perspectives on the same practice.

As you will soon find, programming is just as varied in practice as many other disciplines, and so the more ideas you can be exposed to early on, the better.

## What are the goals of this series?

The goal of this series is to:


* Teach the reader how to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, more digestible pieces, i.e. "thinking like an engineer"
* Introduce the reader to the various ways in which human ideas can be expressed through software
* Familiarize the reader with Python syntax, enough to get ideas from head to disk :)

## What if I need more help?

If you find yourself in need of some additional help while going through this tutorial series, ask a fellow programmer friend to help work through a particular problem. If you're feeling particularly social, feel free to contact me directly via [email](mailto:jeremyalucas@gmail.com).
