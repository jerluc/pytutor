# A small code example

Below is a short snippet of code for you to try and read. Don't worry if you can't understand it completely at first, we'll go through it line-by-line later:

```python
tax_rate = 0.0875
subtotal = 10.00
total = subtotal * (1.0 + tax_rate)

print('Your total is:')
print(total)
```
