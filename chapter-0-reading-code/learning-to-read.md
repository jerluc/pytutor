# Learning to read

One of the most important skills to practice as a programmer is your ability to read code.

"What code?" you might ask? Well, pretty much any code! Seriously, just as it helps to read a lot of books to practice reading in a particular language, I highly encourage you to browse around public open source code repositories for code to read ([GitHub](https://github.com/) is a great resource for this). Even if you don't understand every bit of it, maybe you'll learn something from reading some parts, or maybe you'll find a bug to fix!

> You will find that the majority of the first half of this series will be primarily focused on reading code that you will be initially unfamiliar with. This is not meant to confuse you, but rather to get you used to the idea that in order to be a successful programmer, you will need to practice reading code written by many people other than yourself, perhaps decades before you are reading it.

> Additionally, I will try to include links to various open source code as further illustrations of some of the concepts being discussed throughout this tutorial series.
